njump
=====

njump is a HTTP Nostr static gateway that allows you to browse profiles, notes and relays; it is an easy way to preview a resource and then open it with your preferred client. The typical use of njump is to share a resource outside the Nostr world, where the Nostr: schema is not (yet) working.

njump has some special features to effectively share notes on platforms that offer links preview, like Twitter and Telegram.

njump currently lives under [njump.me](https://njump.me), you can reach it appending a Nostr NIP-19 entity (npub, nevent, nprofile, naddr, etc.) or a NIP-05 address after the domain, e.g. `njump.me/nevent1xxxxxx...xxx` or `njump.me/xxxx@zzzzz.com`

For more information about njump's philosophy and its use, read the presentation [on the homepage](https://njump.me).
